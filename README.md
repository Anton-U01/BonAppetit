The application should provide Guest (not logged in) users with the functionality to log in, register and view the Index page.
The application should provide Users (logged in) with the functionality to log out, add a new recipe (Add Recipe page), view all recipes (Home page) and add recipes to Favourites section.
Bon App-Ã©tit in navbar should redirect to the appropriate URL depending on that if the user is logged in.
The application should provide functionality for adding recipes with category of Main Dish, Dessert or Cocktail.

On the Home Page, recipes should be organized into their respective categories: main dish recipes in the Main Dishes section, dessert recipes in the Desserts section, cocktail recipes in the Cocktails section, and favorite recipes in the Favorites section.
Above these sections, a greeting text displaying the current user's username is located: "Welcome, {username}".
Next to the name of each section on the Home page is a counter indicating the number of recipes in the current section.
Each recipe is accompanied by a star with a plus icon. When clicked, the selected recipe stays in the current section but is also added to the current user's favourite recipes collection. If the recipe is already present in the favorites collection, no action should be taken.
